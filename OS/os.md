# 💻 Operating System (OS)?

       An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources,
       and provides services for computer programs.

### 🔑 Key Functions:

- **Interface** between user and hardware (via GUI or CLI)
- **Manages** hardware like CPU, memory, disk, and input/output devices
- **Runs** and manages applications
- **Handles** security, file systems, networking, and process scheduling

### 📱 Examples:

        •Windows
        •Linux
        •macOS
        •Android
        •iOS

# 🧠 Kernel?

       The Kernel is the core part of the operating system. It directly interacts with the
        hardware and manages system resources.

### 🔧 Responsibilities:

- **•Memory management –** allocates and deallocates memory.
- **•Process management –** starts, stops, and schedules processes.
- **•Device management –** communicates with hardware through device drivers.
- **•System calls –** provides an API for user programs to request OS services.

### 🧬 Types of Kernels:

- **1.Monolithic Kernel –** All OS services run in one space (e.g., Linux).
- **2.Microkernel –** Only essential services run in kernel space; others run in user space (e.g., Minix).
- **3.Hybrid Kernel –** Combines both (e.g., Windows, macOS).
