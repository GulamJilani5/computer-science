# ⏺️Achieving Concurrency

## ➡️ Java

### 🟦 How

Concurrency is achieved using threads with `synchronized`, `volatile`, and `Atomic` classes for thread safety.

### 🟦 Mechanism:

**Threads** (via Thread or Executor) run tasks concurrently. `Synchronized` ensures exclusive access, `volatile` ensures variable visibility, and `Atomic` classes provide lock-free operations.

### 🟦 Lock-free structures & atomics:

- `java.util.concurrent.atomic.\*` (e.g., `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`) — CAS-based, non-blocking.
- Non-blocking collections (`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, `ConcurrentHashMap`) — internally CAS-based.

### 🟦 Kitchen Analogy:

Assistants (threads) share a kitchen, locking the stove (`synchronized`), updating a shared whiteboard (`volatile`), or using a safe counter (`AtomicInteger`) to avoid conflicts.

## ➡️ JavaScript

### 🟦 How

Concurrency is achieved via an asynchronous, event-driven model using the event loop, with optional parallelism via **Web Workers** or Node.js `worker_threads`.

### 🟦 Mechanism:

The single-threaded event loop processes tasks (**e.g.**, via `Promises`, `async/await`) non-blockingly. I/O tasks are offloaded (**e.g.**, to Node.js’s libuv thread pool or browser APIs).

### 🟦 Kitchen Analogy:

A single chef (main thread) juggles tasks via a to-do list (event loop), delegating slow tasks (I/O) to a hidden team (thread pool) or hiring separate chefs (Web Workers) for parallel work.

## ➡️ Go(Golang)

### 🟦 How

Concurrency is achieved using `goroutines` (lightweight threads) and `channels` (thread-safe communication).

### 🟦 Mechanism:

Goroutines run functions concurrently, managed by the Go runtime. Channels allow goroutines to pass data safely, avoiding shared memory conflicts.

### 🟦 Kitchen Analogy:

Assistants (goroutines) in a kitchen work on dishes concurrently, passing ingredients via a conveyor belt (channel) to coordinate without fighting over tools.
