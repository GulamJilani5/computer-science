# IP

It is a set of rules that defines how data is addressed and sent between devices over a network.

### Purpose

- IPâ€™s main job is to identify devices on a network and route data between them.
- Every device gets a unique IP address (like a postal address) so that data knows where to go.

### Key Points

- **IP Address:** A unique number assigned to each device.
- **IPv4:** 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.10`)
- **IPv6:** 128-bit address (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`)
