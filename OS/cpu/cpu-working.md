# Taking Analogy of my laptop (AMD Ryzen 5 5500U processor.)

## My CPU Has:

- **6 physical cores →** Think of them as 6 chefs in a kitchen.
- **12 threads →** Each chef has 2 hands, so each can work on 2 different tasks at the same time (thanks to SMT — Simultaneous Multithreading).

### Thread Scheduling

- **If you have ≤ 6 threads running →** Each one gets its own core, running at full speed, truly in parallel.

- **If you have 7–12 threads →** Each core uses SMT to run 2 threads almost simultaneously.

  They share resources in the core (like caches and execution units).
  They don’t truly double the speed, but they can keep the CPU busy while one thread is waiting for something (like RAM).

- **If you have > 12 threads → Windows starts time-slicing —** pausing threads for a few milliseconds, running others, and switching back fast enough that you feel they’re all running.

### What’s Happening Inside One Core

- Both threads share the same resources:
  - Kitchen stove (execution units)
  - Storage shelves (cache)
  - Ingredients (registers)
- If **Thread A** is waiting (**e.g.**, data from RAM), **Thread B** can use those resources → less idle time, more work done.

### If You Have More Than 12 Threads

- **Example:** You open 20 apps at once (20 threads).

  - First 12 → Run directly (6 cores × 2 threads).
  - Remaining 8 → Wait in line.
  - **Time-slicing** happens: Windows swaps threads in/out very fast (thousands of times per second) so you feel they’re running together.
