# 💻 Operating System (OS)?

       An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources,
       and provides services for computer programs.

### 🔑 Key Functions:

        •**Interface** between user and hardware (via GUI or CLI)
        •**Manages** hardware like CPU, memory, disk, and input/output devices
        •Runs and manages applications
        •Handles security, file systems, networking, and process scheduling

### 📱 Examples:

        •Windows
        •Linux
        •macOS
        •Android
        •iOS

# 🧠 Kernel?

       The Kernel is the core part of the operating system. It directly interacts with the
        hardware and manages system resources.

### 🔧 Responsibilities:

        •Memory management – allocates and deallocates memory.
        •Process management – starts, stops, and schedules processes.
        •Device management – communicates with hardware through device drivers.
        •System calls – provides an API for user programs to request OS services.

### 🧬 T•ypes of Kernels:

        •Monolithic Kernel – All OS services run in one space (e.g., Linux).
        •Microkernel – Only essential services run in kernel space; others run in user space (e.g., Minix).
        •Hybrid Kernel – Combines both (e.g., Windows, macOS).
