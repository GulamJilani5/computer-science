# ‚è∫Ô∏è Taking Analogy of my laptop (AMD Ryzen 5 5500U processor.)

## My CPU Has:

- Taking my Laptop example to understand the CPU, Core, Thread, Multithreading and Parallelism.
- **6 physical cores ‚Üí** Think of them as 6 chefs in a kitchen.
- **12 threads ‚Üí** Each chef has 2 hands, so each can work on 2 different tasks at the same time (thanks to SMT ‚Äî Simultaneous Multithreading).

### ‚û°Ô∏è Thread Scheduling

- **If you have ‚â§ 6 threads running ‚Üí** Each one gets its own core, running at full speed, truly in parallel.

- **If you have 7‚Äì12 threads ‚Üí** Each core uses SMT to run 2 threads almost simultaneously.

  They share resources in the core (like caches and execution units).
  They don‚Äôt truly double the speed, but they can keep the CPU busy while one thread is waiting for something (like RAM).

- **If you have > 12 threads ‚Üí Windows starts time-slicing ‚Äî** pausing threads for a few milliseconds, running others, and switching back fast enough that you feel they‚Äôre all running.

### ‚û°Ô∏è What‚Äôs Happening Inside One Core

- Both threads share the same resources:
  - Kitchen stove (execution units)
  - Storage shelves (cache)
  - Ingredients (registers)
- If **Thread A** is waiting (**e.g.**, data from RAM), **Thread B** can use those resources ‚Üí less idle time, more work done.

### ‚û°Ô∏è If You Have More Than 12 Threads

- **Example:** You open 20 apps at once (20 threads).
  - First 12 ‚Üí Run directly (6 cores √ó 2 threads).
  - Remaining 8 ‚Üí Wait in line.
  - **Time-slicing** happens: Windows swaps threads in/out very fast (thousands of times per second) so you feel they‚Äôre running together.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Time Slicing (CPU Scheduling)

- Imagine your CPU as having 12 chairs (threads) in a room.
- If you have 20 tasks, 12 sit on the chairs and start working.
- The other 8 stand outside, waiting for a turn.
- The CPU quickly swaps who sits in the chairs ‚Äî this happens thousands of times per second.
- To you, it looks like all 20 are working at the same time, but in reality each core is just switching between them
  so fast that you don‚Äôt notice the waiting.
- This is synchronous, but interleaved ‚Äî the CPU runs one thread, pauses it, runs another, etc.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Time Slicing vs Asynchronous

- **Time slicing** = CPU magic to make many threads appear to run at once.
- **Async** = Programmer magic to avoid wasting CPU time while waiting.

| **Time Slicing**                                                                                 | **Asynchronous**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Managed by **OS/CPU Scheduler**                                                                  | Managed by **programming logic**                            |
| Simulates parallelism(But not actually Parallel) when there are more threads than CPU can handle | Avoids blocking by doing other work while waiting           |
| Still **shares the same CPU time**                                                               | Can **delegate work** outside CPU (e.g., I/O)               |
| Example: CPU switches between 20 threads on 12 logical processors                                | Example: JavaScript `async/await`, Java `CompletableFuture` |
